#summary PTF launcher: Have your PRTG Server launch external applications.
#sidebar PTF_Sidebar

= Introduction =

PTF launcher is a Custom Notification that can launch external applications.

PRTG Server runs as a service and therefore cannot start applications that interact with the desktop.
With PTF Launcher, this is no longer an issue.


= Prerequisites =
PTF Launcher targets the .Net Framework 2.0 that comes with Windows update and is already included in the default installation of Windows 7.

= Installation =
The download includes two .exe files:
 * Launch.exe is the Custom Notification and needs to be copied to the *\Notifications\EXE* subfolder of your PRTG installation. 
 * Launcher.exe is a system tray application that needs to be started on your PRTG server or any other Windows computer that has a user loggedin.
The Launch.exe Custom Notification parses the details of the external application that needs to be started to the Launcher.exe tray application that actually starts the external application.

= Start the Launcher application =
Once the Launcher application is started, it will be visible in your system tray (next to the clock).

_For the launcher application to work, a user must always be logged into the computer running the launcher application._

PTF Launcher is “session aware”, if two or more RDP sessions on the same server both run PTF Launcher, only one session will start the external application. 

*Tip:* Copy Launcher.exe to the startup folder of the computer it is running on to have it automatically started when the computer is restarting.

= Custom Notification =

In the parameter section of the Custom Notification you have to provide details about the application that has to be started.

*Basic parameters:*

{{{
-s=	Application to start
-a=	Arguments for the application to start
-k=	Application to kill
}}}

*Advanced Parameters*

{{{
-c=	If Launcher.exe runs on a computer different from your PRTG Server, the IP-Address or DNS name of the computer where Launcher.exe runs.
-u=	Domain\username of an account with access rights to the c$ of the specified computer.
-p=	Password or passhash* of an account with access rights to the c$ of the specified computer.
-io=    Activate a comport on the target machine.
}}}

A passhash can be generated with the [PTF_CS_PassHashTool PassHash Tool].

== A few examples ==
To open a new command window with ipconfig:
{{{
-s=cmd -a=/K ipconfig /ALL
}}}

To kill the existing command window and ping the sensors parent device in a new command window:
{{{
-k=cmd -s=cmd -a=/K ping %host
}}}

To activate a comport on the target machine:
{{{
-io=4,7,1 will activate the relay connected to pin 7 on comport 4.
-io=4,7,0 will deactivate the relay connected to pin 7 on comport 4.
-io=4,7,1,5 will activate the relay connected to pin 7 on comport 4 for 5 seconds.
}}}

The illustration below shows you how to wire the comport on the target machine:

*Note:* the illustration above is for demonstration purposes only and although it will work, it is always better to use an optocoupler, protecting your comport.
